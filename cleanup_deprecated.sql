-- Cleanup Script: Mark deprecated fields and remove old code references

BEGIN;

-- Mark deprecated columns with comments
COMMENT ON COLUMN products.inventory_count IS 'DEPRECATED: Use inventory table instead. This field is no longer maintained after migration to single source of truth.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN products.variants IS 'DEPRECATED: Use product_variants and inventory tables instead. This JSONB field is replaced by relational tables.';

-- Optional: You can drop these columns after ensuring all code is updated
-- Uncomment the lines below only after thorough testing:

-- ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS inventory_count;
-- ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS variants;

-- Create a summary of the migration
SELECT 
    'Migration Summary' as status,
    COUNT(*) as total_products,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory) as inventory_records,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_variants) as variant_types,
    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM inventory) as total_inventory_quantity
FROM products;

COMMIT;

-- Note: After running this script:
-- 1. The deprecated fields are marked with comments
-- 2. All APIs now use the inventory table as single source of truth
-- 3. Frontend components have been updated to use new data structure
-- 4. Mobile API uses inventory table for detailed variant information
-- 5. Data consistency has been verified

-- To complete the cleanup:
-- 1. Monitor the application for 1-2 weeks to ensure stability
-- 2. Once confident, uncomment the DROP COLUMN statements above
-- 3. Remove any remaining references to inventory_count and variants JSONB field
